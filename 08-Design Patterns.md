# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

## Overview

- There are officially **23 design patterns**.
- A design pattern is **not a specific piece of code**, but a **general concept** for solving a particular problem.
- Unlike an algorithm, which defines a clear set of steps to achieve a goal, a pattern provides a **blueprint** for a solution.
- The core idea behind patterns is that **some classes change frequently while others remain stable**, so we separate them to manage change effectively.
- Pattern concepts are now used **beyond object-oriented programming** in many areas of software development.
- Design patterns give developers a **shared vocabulary**, making communication easier.
- Patterns can sometimes turn into **rigid rules (dogma)** instead of flexible guidelines.
- Some patterns solve **small, simple problems**, while others help shape **entire system architectures**.

## Categories of Design Patterns

There are three main categories of design patterns:

### 1. Creational Patterns
- Focus on **how objects are created**

### 2. Structural Patterns
- Show how to **combine classes and objects** into larger structures efficiently

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
- Focus on **how objects communicate**
