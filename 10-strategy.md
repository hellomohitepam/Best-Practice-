if we want to very algo in run time then strategy or if object creation then factory


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategy design pattern :- Defines a family of algorithms, put them into separate classes so that they can be changed at run time.

we can call these strategies as algo

fever composition over inheritence

the one who use the algo are client class
strategies are like talking, walking

Conclusion

Encapsulate what varies & keep it separate from what remains same.

Solution to inheritance is not more inheritance.

Composition should be favoured over inheritance.

Code to interface & not to concrete.

Do NOT repeat yourself (DRY).
